# UAS-Coding-Challenge
Follow the request from UBC Unmanned aircraft design team, designed an "machine learning" algorithm 
to recognize handwriting digits given a number of data set.  Familiarized with python and first time 
to code on machine learning related program.  Current results of recognition logged as 87.5%, need 
improvement on the speed of computing and storing data.
